# gestionale_calcio_mvc_flutter

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

ALL THE FUNCTIONS OF OUR APPLICATION WILL BE MANAGED HERE WITH THE MVC PATTERN

MVC ==> Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a pattern used in programming to divide the code into blocks with distinct functionality.
MODEL: contains data access methods.
VIEW: it deals with displaying the data to the user and manages the interaction between the latter and the underlying infrastructure.
CONTROLLER: receives commands from the user through the View and reacts by carrying out operations that may affect the Model and which generally lead to a change in the state of the View.
