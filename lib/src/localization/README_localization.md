STEPS TO DO:
1. MANAGE DEPENDENCIES (Add the Following lines in pubspec.yaml file);

2. CREATE NEW FILES AND FOLDER (To handle localizations we will need to create the following files and folder structure in your lib/ folder
Each of the app_<language_code>.arb file will contain the translation of our text to that particular language);

3. CREATE A L10.YAML LINE (This file will reference our language folder and default language file);

4. DEFINE THE LOCALES WE WILL BE WORKING WITH (Inside l10n.dart, create a class which keeps all the locales we will offer in the application);

5. ADD TRANSLATIONS TO .ARB FILES (In the newly created app_<language_code>.arb files add a Key-Value pair of text and its translation into that language.);

6. CONFIGURE THE MAIN WIDGETS IN OUR APP (Restart your app if your app is already running. Then in main.dart add the following import statements:
       import 'package:flutter_localizations/flutter_localizations.dart';
       import 'package:flutter_gen/gen_l10n/app_localizations.dart';
   After these imports add the Localization delegates to the Material App widget in your main.dart. Note that app_localizations.dart file will be autogenerated when you restart your application.);

7. FINALLY USE YOUR LOCALIZED TEXT IN YOUR TEXT WIDGET (You can access all the keys we have created in our app_<language_code>.arb files using the given syntax)
