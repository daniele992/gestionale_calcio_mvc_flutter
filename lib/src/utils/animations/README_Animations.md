## Getting Started Animations

If you want something very scenic, you can use Rive or Lottie for custom SVG-based animations.

- https://lottiefiles.com/ (Make sure you download an animation from lottiefiles.com, such as an
  animated like or check icon, and place it in your assets/lottie/ folder.)
- https://rive.app/ (Go to rive.app and download one of the available animations. Add the .riv file
  to the assets/rive/ folder.)
