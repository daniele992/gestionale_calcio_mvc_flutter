# gestionale_calcio_mvc_flutter

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started app_bindings

- GetX package for state and dependency management in Flutter

- Get.lazyPut() is a method that is used to register an instance of a controller (or any other
  dependency) with the GetX dependency
  management system. The unique thing about lazyPut is that the object is only created when it is
  first needed. This is useful for optimizing
  resources and delaying the creation of the object until it is actually needed.

- SignUpController() This is an anonymous function that returns an instance of the SignUpController.
  The object is not created immediately,
  but is only created when the controller is actually required in the code.

- The fenix parameter (which means phoenix in Latin) is an option that changes the behavior of
  Get.lazyPut(). When fenix: true is passed as a parameter:
  Makes the dependency "restorable": If the object is removed from memory (for example, if the
  controller instance was "destroyed"
  or the controller was removed from the lifecycle), it will be automatically recreated the next
  time it is requested.
