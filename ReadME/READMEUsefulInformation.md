## Driver
If you are developing on Windows and want to connect a device for testing, you need to install the appropriate USB driver.

WHAT ARE USB DRIVERS?
USB drivers are a software program that allows a hardware device to communicate with the operating system. Installing the necessary drivers will help your PC recognize the type of device connected. 
You may already know that there are many devices that support USB connections. These include keyboards, mice, cameras, external hardware and, of course, your smartphone.
For this reason, your PC needs appropriate USB drivers to distinguish the type of device actually connected. Once the USB drivers are installed, you will be able to generate the options and user interface 
necessary to perform the desired tasks while keeping the connected device active. Simply put, this software allows the computer to recognize the connected device and act accordingly
